## Goals

- Learn basic geofencing with MapKit.
- Invoke a HTTP request to an external API and notify the user with a local notification when the user enters or exits a geographic region.

## Getting Started

- Clone
- Change coordinate values in `MapViewModel`'s `mapDefaults` with your coordinates. [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) may help. 
- Run the app on your physical device
- Walk around and trigger notifications/API calls!
